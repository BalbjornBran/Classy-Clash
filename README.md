# Classy-Clash
 Small topdown game made with Raylib library in c++. Just for learning more stuff.
 By Balbjorn Bran
 
 In this project, we are going to be playing a topdown game, where the player
 needs to kill 2 enemies using left mouse button to attack, and WASD for moving. 
 If not, he will receive damage and eventually die.
 (just 2 enemies, and thats it, I'm just doing this really quick)
 
 This is also very simple, we are going to be learning the fundamentals of object
 oriented programing with inheritances and different classes.
 
 Not gonna go too deep or complex on this game, just something really quick.
 
You can download the project and open the -worskpace with vscode.
There is also a .exe file there where you can just play.
